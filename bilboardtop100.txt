Tasdasdasdsds 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing songs in the United States. 
Its data is compiled by Luminate Data and published by American music magazine Billboard. 
The chart is based on each song's weekly physical and digital sales 
collectively, the amount of airplay impressions it receives on American radio stations, 
and its audio and video streams on online digital music platforms.

"Last Night" by American country singer Morgan Wallen is the year's longest-running number-one song on the Hot 100 in 2023, 
having spent sixteen weeks at the top spot;[1] it subsequently topped the Billboard Year-End Hot 100.
[2] "Flowers" by American singer Miley Cyrus is the longest running number-one by a female artist, 
ruling the Hot 100 for eight weeks.[3] Four country songs—Wallen's "Last Night", Jason Aldean's "Try That in a Small Town", 
Oliver Anthony's "Rich Men North of Richmond", and "I Remember Everything" by Zach Bryan and Kacey Musgraves—held the number-one 
spot on the Hot 100 in consecutive weeks for the first time ever.
[4] "Paint the Town Red" by Doja Cat became the first rap song to top the Hot 100 in over a year.[note 1]
Taylor Swift topped the chart for seven weeks; 
"Cruel Summer" and "Is It Over Now?" marked the 10th and 11th number-one songs of her career, respectively.

Nineteen artists have charted at number one in 2023, with ten―Wallen, Jimin, SZA, Jungkook, Latto, Aldean, Anthony, Bryan, 
Musgraves and J. Cole―reaching the top spot for the first time. SZA and Drake charted two number-one songs this year, 
whereas Taylor Swift became the first artist in history to chart three number-one songs—each from a different album—on the 
Hot 100 in one calendar year.[note 2] Swift's "Is It Over Now?" (2023) dethroned her own "Cruel Summer" 
(2023) at number one on the chart dated November 11, 2023,[6] and the vice versa occurred the next week, 
making Swift the first woman to replace herself at the top spot two and three times.
